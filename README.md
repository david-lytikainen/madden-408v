Madden prediction

## General Goal
The goal of this project is to create a classifier that can predict the madden rating of a particular NFL player. 

## Meaning of different classes
We will be classifying players into rating buckets. Madden ratings generally range from 50-99. We will classify players into ranges of overall rating, on a scale of 1-5.

Players rated <75: Class 1 (Below average)
Players rated 76-82: Class 2 (Average)
Players rated 83-88: Class 3 (Above Average)
Players rated 89-94: Class 4 (Exceptional)
Players rated 95+: Class 5 (The best)
